### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently working on THIS page you're currently reading.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new things that I happen to find interesting, whatever they may be... (basically just random interesting stuff)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on nothing... for now.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with maybe my page, but also not really, y'know?
- 💬 Ask me about whatever, I dunno 
- 📫 How to reach me: Shout to the stars or ask a tree :P
- ⚡ Fun fact: An elephant's brain reacts the same way to humans as we do to puppies or kittens, they basically think we're tiny and cute.
